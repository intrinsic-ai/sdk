// SceneObject is the physical building block for the world modeled as a tree of
// entities, each with a specific set of properties.
//
// Requirements for a scene object to be valid:
// - Should have at least one `Link` entity.
// - Should have exactly one root entity. A root entity must not set its
// `parent_name` field and should be a `Frame` or a `Link`. Its `parent_t_this`
// field, if set, is ignored.
// - Every entity, except the root entity, should provide `parent_name`.
// - Every entity in `entities` must have a unique `name`.
// - Each `Joint` entity must have at one parent link and one child link.
// - Each `Sensor` entity must have a parent link or joint.
